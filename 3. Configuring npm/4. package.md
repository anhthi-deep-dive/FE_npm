# peerDependencies

In some cases, you want to `express the compatibility of your package with a host tool or library`, while not necessarily doing a require of this host. This is usually referred to as a plugin

```
  {
    "name": "tea-latte",
    "version": "1.3.5",
    "peerDependencies": {
      "tea": "2.x"
    }
  }
```

This ensures your `package tea-latte` can be `installed along` with the `second major version` of the host package tea only
