# Executables

When in global mode, executables are linked into {prefix}/bin on Unix, or directly into {prefix} on Windows

When in local mode, executables are `linked into ./node_modules/.bin` so that they can be made available to scripts run through npm

# Cache

Cache files are stored in ~/.npm on Posix, or %LocalAppData%/npm-cache on Windows.

# More Information

When you run `npm install foo@1.2.3`, then the `package is loaded into the cache`, and then `unpacked into ./node_modules/foo`. Then, any of `foo's dependencies` are similarly `unpacked into ./node_modules/foo/node_modules/...`

Any `bin files are symlinked to ./node_modules/.bin/`, so that they may be found by npm scripts when necessary
