# Description

package-lock.json is `automatically generated` for any operations where `npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json`

This file is intended to be committed into source repositories, and serves various purposes:

- `Describe a single representation of a dependency tree` such that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are `guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies`

- Provide a facility for users to "time-travel" to `previous states of node_modules` without having to commit the directory itself

- `Optimize the installation process` by allowing npm to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages

# Hidden Lockfiles

In order to `avoid processing the node_modules folder repeatedly`, npm as of v7 uses a `"hidden" lockfile` present in `node_modules/.package-lock.json`
